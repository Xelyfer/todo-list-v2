# todo-list-v2
Made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose and lodash. Upgraded the previous Todo-list with mongoDB to hold and store the data. Also allowed the ability to create custom todo-lists by inputting in a custom URL ( /Work will create a todo-list for Work ). Implemented the deletion of specific lists by clicking on the checkbox. Following App Bewery's course.
